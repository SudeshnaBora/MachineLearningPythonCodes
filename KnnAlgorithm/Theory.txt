This contains the knn algorithm of the book Machine Learning in Action.

The basic principle of this algorithm (as of now) is as follows:-

1. It consist of a well classified training set data. 

2. The test data is individually checked with each data of the training set to get the similarity index.

3. The closest k (which is usually <20) is studied for the concluding classification.

4. The majority of the classes gives the resultant classification of the test data.

Some important as of now is as follows:-

1. It is viable only for numeric data.

2. It does not actually train the algorithm. 

3. It is expensive.
